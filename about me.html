        <p>Hello, my name is Jenisha Patel, and I am a high school student studying at Chinguacousy Secondary School in their SciTech program. I was born on July 18th, 2008, and am currently 15 years old. Some things that I enjoy are arts, such as drawing, painting, and dance. I have always had a passion for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, & Math); however, it was only last summer where I discovered how much I enjoyed programming and computer science. ADD MORE

            <p>I've always been interested in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering & Math). However, it was only last summer when I discovered how much I enjoyed programming and computer science. I took a summer course where I learned basic Python. This ended up helping me a lot in my computer science class. Ever since, I've been improving my coding skills as well as starting my journey of learning web development.<br> If you would like to see some more of my coding & web development projects: <a href="coding_projects.html">Coding Projects</a> </p>
