            <p>Hello, my name is Jenisha Patel, and I am a high school student studying at Chinguacousy Secondary School in their SciTech program. I was born on July 18th, 2008, and am currently 15 years old. Some things that I enjoy are arts, such as drawing, painting, and dance. I have always had a passion for STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, & Math); however, it was only last summer where I discovered how much I enjoyed programming and computer science. You can learn more about my intrests in the slides below.</p>

Some other things I enjoy doing in my free time is taking walks around Chinguacousy Park which is very close to my house. You will often find me walking places that are less than an hour away since I prefer to walk and get exersize rather than wait for a bus. Another thing I enjoy doing in my free time is dancing, this is something that i've enjoyed since I was a young child.I've done mutltiple bollywood dance preformances when I was a child, as well as joing Chinguacousy's Kpop Dance Club, Garba Team, as well as our Bollywood Theatre Club.</p>

However, it was only last summer when I discovered how much I enjoyed programming and computer science. I took a summer course where I learned basic Python. This ended up helping me a lot in my computer science class. Ever since, I've been improving my coding skills as well as starting my journey of learning web development. If you would like to see some more of my coding & web development projects and learn more about my journey.</p>
